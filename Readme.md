My task with this Bootcamp assignment is to clean up the index.html file inside this repo to allow for a user story (shown below):

### User Story
___
`AS a marketing agency`<br>
`I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards`<br>
`SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines`

To meet the Accessiblity Standards the following criteria needs to be met:
